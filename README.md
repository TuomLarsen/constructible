Representing Constructible Numbers in Python
============================================

The constructible module provides exact representation of 
[contructible numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructible_number) in Python.

The constructible numbers are the smallest field containing the rational numbers, where the square root of
any non-negative constructible number is constructible as well. The non-negative constructible numbers are 
the lengths which can be constructed from the unit length using only a compass and a straightedge.
